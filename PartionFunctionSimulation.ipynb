    "##What is Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "It's a web broswer based application that allows you to present formatted(Markdown) texts and code with inline running results. It has two primary components: the Cell and Kernal. Cell refers to each visual block displayed in the browser that either represents a paragraph of texts or excutable code. Kernal is the computation engine used to execute and output the executable code in the cells. In our case, Kernal is the specific python.exe installed on your local machine. It allows easy text/picture editting and enables audience to run codes in real time to see the results. \n",

    "##Launch Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "* Download the example code from [link](Add The link you would like to have the code on, probably somewhere on physics department server)\n",
    "* Open Anaconda on your local machine, [install](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) it if you have not yet\n",
    "* Click on the Jupyter Notebook logo. It should automatically opens the default web-browser showing the Jupyter Dashboard.\n",
    "* Navigate the folders to where the example code is stored on your local machine\n",
